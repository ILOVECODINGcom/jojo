                <p class="scroll-animated">I am a 19-year-old first-year student at University College London (UCL). I
                    have a passion for traveling, exploring new places, and immersing myself in diverse cultures.
                    Staying active through sports helps me maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Cooking is another
                    joy of mine, where I can unwind and experiment with flavors, creating meals to share with friends
                    and family.</p>

                <p class="scroll-animated">At this stage in my life, I am eager to embrace new experiences, both
                    academically and personally. Whether it's discovering new destinations, improving my skills, or
                    meeting people from around the world, I aim to make the most of my time at university while growing
                    into the best version of myself.</p>

                                <p> In high school, I initiated and organized a volunteer program dedicated to rescuing
                                    stray cats. Working alongside fellow students, we created awareness campaigns,
                                    arranged for veterinary care, and found loving homes for the cats in need. This
                                    experience not only deepened my love for animals but also taught me the importance
                                    of teamwork, leadership, and compassion in making a tangible difference.</p>

                                    of Sanya, China. I joined efforts to clean up the coastline, collecting litter to
                                    protect the marine environment and preserve the natural beauty of the area. This

                                    left-behind children, providing them with essential supplies and small comforts.
                                    This experience allowed me to combine creativity with compassion, fostering a sense

                            <p class="subline">Feeding them</p>

                            <p>The mother cat gave birth to a litter of kittens at our high school, but unfortunately,
                                one of the kittens did not survive the cold and froze to death. Witnessing this made us
                                realize the importance of taking action to protect the animals around us. Together, we
                                worked to provide a safe and warm environment for the remaining kittens, ensuring they
                                were healthy and cared for.</p>

                            <p>Later, we found loving adoption homes for the surviving kittens, giving them a chance at
                                a better life. To prevent future litters and protect the mother cat's health, we
                                arranged for her to be spayed. Afterward, we brought her back to the school, where we
                                placed her in a cozy cat shelter and continued to feed and care for her. This experience
                                taught us the value of compassion and responsibility in making a difference, no matter
                                how small.</p>

                            <p>We spent the entire afternoon cleaning up the litter scattered along the coastline. Every
                                piece of trash we picked up felt like a small step toward protecting the ocean and
                                preserving its natural beauty. The effort was tiring but deeply rewarding as we watched
                                the shore gradually transform back to its pristine state.</p>

                            <p>By the time we took this photo, it was already evening. The golden hues of the sunset
                                reflected off the calm waves, as if the ocean itself was showing gratitude for our hard
                                work. Standing there, with the cool breeze and the sound of the waves, we felt a deep
                                connection to nature and a renewed sense of responsibility to protect it.</p>

                                through bartering, we collected supplies and essentials that could be donated to
                                left-behind children, offering them a small token of care and support.</p>

                            <p>By sharing the beauty of flowers, we hoped to spread love and hope to those in need. The
                                event not only brought people together but also reminded us of the power of compassion
                                and small actions in creating a positive impact on others' lives.</p>

                            <p>While traveling in Tibet, I happened to meet a young herder boy on the plateau. He was
                                tending to a group of cattle by himself, and seeing his dedication piqued my curiosity.
                                After a brief conversation, I decided to help him for the afternoon, stepping into his
                                world of vast grasslands and quiet companionship with nature.</p>

                            <p>For the next few hours, I experienced the simplicity and serenity of herding cattle on
                                the plateau. The mountains stretched endlessly on the horizon, and the cool breeze
                                carried with it a sense of calm. This unexpected encounter became one of the most
                                memorable parts of my journey, giving me a deeper appreciation for the life and culture
                                of the Tibetan highlands.</p>
